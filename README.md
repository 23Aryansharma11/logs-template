# 🪵 Dev Logs — Start Logging Your Grind

Hey nerds,

Start logging your day.

Because writing logs isn't just for servers. It's for **you** to track your growth, document your wins, and build a habit that compounds over time. Logging your day is like version control for your brain. You’ll thank yourself later.

This is a **simple**, **minimal**, and **beautiful** template I built for devs who want clarity without the clutter.
Feel free to use it, fork it, or build on top of it.

## 🚀 Getting Started

- **Step 0:** You already know how to fork and clone the repo, use `pnpm` cause `npm` isn't fun to type.
- **Step 1:** Add your details in [`site-config.ts`](./src/site-config.ts) .
- **Step 2:** Start logging in [`logs.ts`](./src/logs.ts) I'll take care of the rest.
